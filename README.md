# Next Trip

It is a service for travelers to find interesting routes based on photos from Instagram. We use Instagam’s API.

What our project represents:

  - This is a service for travelers who are going to go to a new place and do not know what to watch there
  - Many people are looking for interesting places in instagram, viewing popular photos
  - In our service user can see the most interesting places with a top instagram photo close to him and build a route on them
  - In the future we can add category selection, for example, filters: "bars close to me" or "galleries close to me" or something else
  - We will provide a link below each photo to the owner’s instagram account.
